# Project Name: DataEntryPortal

[Required system imports:]
  import sys

[Program Overview]
  The purpose of this project is to allow users to report data on the progress of their substance use prevention intervention implementation as well as populations served, successes and challenges. The DataEntryProtal creates a report in a separate file for users to review which includes their responses displayed in a list or data visualization format. 
  
[Password Verification]
  Once the code is downloaded, the user will be welcomed to the portal and asked for the password, which is "janeDoe".  If the user enters the correct password, the program will print, "Access Granted," and will be asked to enter their name.  If the user does not enter the correct password, the program will print, "Incorrect Password. Access NOT Granted," and the program will end.
  
[Program Menu]
  After the password verification loop, users will be welcomed to the Data Entry Portal (addressed by the name entered) and the program will enter an endifinite loop named, "tableOfContents," which will repeat until the user exists the program.  
  The portal is broken into four steps (programmed as classes): (1) Step 1 - Demograhics (date, name of agency, point of contact, county served, intervention entered), (2) Step 2 - Workplan Steps, (3) Step 3 - Population(s) Served, (4) Step 4 - Successes and Barriers.  Each of these will be displayed as prompts for the user.  If a user enters "step" and a number 1 - 4 (not case sensitive) or only a number, they will be sent................
  If the user enters "EXIT" (not case sensitive) or 5, they will be thanked for using the Data Entry Portal and the program will end.  If the user enters anything other than the promps, the program will print, "I'm sorry, I do not understand. Please choose the step number you would like to enter data.")
  
[Step 1: Demographics]  
  Users will be asked to enter the date, name of their agency, name of point of contact, name of county they serve, and the name of the substance use prevention intervention implemtned in the county they serve (e.g. Strengthening Families, Too Good For Drugs. Local Capacity Building, Media Campaigns, etc.).  The name of the intervention will be imported to the print statement in Step 2. 
  
  Table???????

[Step 2: Workplan Steps]  
  Users will be asked to select from a multiple choice bank their overall implementation progress for the substance use prevention intervention entered in Step 1.  The choice options include, "A. No activities B. Planning activities only. C. Implementation/maintenance activities"
  Users will then be asked to input yes "y" or no "n" to report if they have or have not completed the five fidelity steps of their workplan.
  
  Pie graph and if steps == 5, or if steps < 5??????????


[Step 3: Population(s) Served]  
?????????????


[Step 4: Successes and Barriers]  
  The last two questions will allow users to describe the successes and barriers faced during the substance use prevention intervention implementation for the county they entered in Step 1.
